Processing a whole book.</A>
</H1>

<P>
Aruspix can also deal with whole books or compilations of pages, providing
a visual index for the book while you work on individual pages within
it. It is much more convenient to pre-process an entire book all at
once than to run each page separately. In order to do this, you need
to make a file for the book or compilation of pages, and prepare a
place to store these pages once they have been edited with Aruspix.
As before, each page within your book should only contain a single
page of music, and be stored as a TIFF file.

<P>
Open Aruspix, and click on the ``New book'' icon in the tools
bar <IMG
  WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./NewBookIcon.png"
 ALT="Image NewBookIcon">. A window will open
with several meta-data fields that you can use to label your book
(Figure <A HREF="#fig:Book-metadata">8</A>). 

<P>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="fig:Book-metadata"></A><A NAME="186"></A>

<P>
All of these fields are optional. If you have a particular name that
want to use for your book, instead of the suggested fields, type that
name into the RISM field. For now, we will use a demo book, and fill
in all the optional fields:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The RISM number is M.0578.
</LI>
<LI>The Composer is Luca Marenzio.
</LI>
<LI>The Title of the Book is ``Libro Primo. Madrigali a 4 voci''
</LI>
<LI>The printer is Alessandro Gardano.
</LI>
<LI>The Year of printing is 1585.
</LI>
<LI>The Library code is I.Nc.2
</LI>
</UL>
Once you have labeled your book, you need to indicate where the images
are stored on your computer, by browsing through the locations under
the heading ``Images''. [find out where these files will be
located if they come as part of the Aruspic demo]. Below that, you
need to indicate where the edited images should be stored once they
are saved in Aruspix. You may choose to store the demo files on your
desktop for now, or create a folder for them somewhere else. When
you have filled in all the fields for this window, click OK.

<P>
You will see that the Aruspix screen is now divided into two sections.
You have your book directory on the left, and a working space on the
right. Before you can pre-process the book, you need to ensure that
only pages that contain music will be run. If you open the file that
is labeled page 01_001.tif. you will see that it is a blank page.
Right click on the file, and you can choose ``deactivate'' from
the menu that appears (Figure <A HREF="#fig:Images-desactivated">9</A>). This
will make the file name turn grey. Do this to the following page as
well, since it is a title page and contains no music.The following
pages from this book need to be deactivated: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Part 01 pages 31-32. 
</LI>
<LI>Part 03 pages 1-3.
</LI>
<LI>Part 04 pages 1-3.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
[there is an existing aruspix file that needs to be removed for
the demo, as well as some red pages that should not appear here.]
Once all the non-music files are deactivated, you can pre-process
the entire book by clicking ``Book'' in the application menu and
choosing ``Batch preprocessing'', or by right-clicking on any
file in the book and choosing ``Batch preprocessing'' from the
menu that appears. Preprocessing will take approximately 1 minute
per page.

<P>
After the preprocessing has finished, you should find a new directory
of pages in the Aruspix files folder, just below the Images folder
on the left-side of the screen. These are the files that you will
be using from now on.

<P>
If you open the first page in the Arupsix files, 01_003, you will
see the colour-coded version of the page that Aruspix will be working
with.

<P>
From here, you can follow the same steps that you used in the demo
for processing a single page.

<P>
There are no corrections in the preprocessing for this page.

<P>
Click ``Run'' in the tools menu, and wait for recognition to complete.
(About 10s)

<P>
Now you are in the editing mode, and the Arupsix window is divided
into three parts. As with the single page, you would at this point
edit the page and correct the alignment, using the editing tools and
keyboard shortcuts. For this demo, it is not necessary to edit the
page. Simply click on the ``Save'' icon, which will make a green
tick appear beside the file on the left screen. Ordinarily it is suggested
that you edit about twenty pages, making all the necessary corrections,
before you optimize the results. Running a full optimization will
improve Aruspix's recognition for the specific book that you are editing,
so it is worthwhile to do this once you have enough pages completed.
Simply choose Book from the Application menu, and then Optimize.

<P>
The time needed for this process depends on the number of pages you
use. Twenty pages takes about 50 minutes, while ten pages takes only
about 20 minutes. Optimization is always a cumulative process, so
if you run a full optimization every twenty pages, the second time
will take about an hour and 45 minutes, since there will be 40 pages
included in the run.

<P>
There are a number of editing tasks and tools that have not yet been
discussed, but which will be worth reading about before you proceed
with your first editing project. These can be found in the Editing
Reference section.
