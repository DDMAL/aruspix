Processing a single page</A>
</H1>

<P>
The first thing you need to do to start transcription is to pre-process
the music images you wish to transcribe. For now, we will begin with
a single page. From the tool bar, click on the third icon <IMG
  WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./OpenNewFileButton.png"
 ALT="Image OpenNewFileButton">.
Find the file ``MarL_1585_M.0578_I.Nc.2_01_028'', and double-click
on it to open it. You should now see the image that you are going
to work with as in figure <A HREF="#fig:Image-processed">3</A>. If at any time
the image you are working with does not fit the screen, use the ``Zoom''
buttons on the tool bar <IMG
  WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="45" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./ZoomButtons.png"
 ALT="Image ZoomButtons">
to adjust the image size.

To pre-process this image, click ``Run'' on the tool menu <IMG
  WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./RunButton.png"
 ALT="Image RunButton">.
In a few seconds the pre-processed version of this page will appear
on your screen. Once your page is pre-processed, the first editing
step must be done. The page is color coded during pre-processing,
and it is necessary to check that everything is correctly labeled.
In this example, there is only one correction to be made: there is
a bit of black border on the upper left-hand side of the image which
should be erased. Double-click on any part of the black border, and
it will all turn red (Figure <A HREF="#fig:Correction-preprocessing">4</A>).
To erase the border, right-click (or &lt;ctrl-click&gt;) over the red, and
a colour-menu will appear (Figure <A HREF="#fig:Pre-processing-categories">5</A>).
Choose ``blank'', and the border will fade out.

Once the page has been corrected at this stage, it is ready for transcription.
Simply click on the ``Run'' icon
for a second time, and wait a few seconds for the process to complete.
If the dialogue box with the transcribing process information seems
to stop and become idle, make sure the command ``Close
this dialog if process completes successfully''
is selected with a tick. This will ensure that in future you will
not have to close the dialogue box yourself every time you transcribe
a page. What should appear before you is a screen split into two sections,
with your original page showing on the top half, and the newly transcribed
page lined up below (Figure <A HREF="#fig:Page-after-recognition">6</A>). In
between the two screens is a third menu bar, the music editing bar.

Before you begin making corrections, it is a good idea to learn how
to move around the page and familiarize yourself with the interface.
For now, you will be working on the bottom screen - the top screen
will be for reference only. As you can see, the first symbol on the
bottom screen is red, while the rest are black. The red symbol indicates
where Aruspix is focussed - it is the cursor. Click on any symbol,
and it will become red. You can also use the arrow keys to move around
the page. There can only be one red symbol at a time - you cannot
work with multiple symbols.

<P>
While you move around the score, you may notice that the music editing
bar changes from time to time. Musical symbols in Aruspix are grouped
into families, and the entire family of each symbol will appear in
the editing bar when one of its members is highlighted. If you return
the cursor to the top of the page, you will see that the first symbol
is a long, and the Notes family shows in the editing bar. Move the
cursor to the next symbol, the flat, and the editing bar will now
show the variants family. 

<P>
Any member of a family of symbols is interchangeable with any other
member of the same family. If you go back the first symbol again,
and then click on the Semi-Minim <IMG
  WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./SemiMinim.png"
 ALT="Image SemiMinim">
in the editing bar, the Long will be changed into a Semi-Minim. Try
changing it back by clicking on the Long button in the editing bar.

<P>
As you can see by comparing the two screens, the first long should
actually be a clef. Because notes and clefs are in different families,
you cannot transform the Long into a clef. You must delete it and
then replace it. To delete the Long, click on it and then press &lt;delete&gt;.
You can use either of the two delete keys (see reference for more
details). Once the Long has been deleted, click on ``Insert''
in the editing bar <IMG
  WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="41" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./InsertButton.png"
 ALT="Image InsertButton">. The
arrow for the mouse should become a pencil. Next, use the pencil to
click on the ``Keys'' button and select the third clef <IMG
  WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./CantoClef.png"
 ALT="Image CantoClef">.
Double-click on the staff where you want to insert this clef, and
it will appear. To return to the editing mode, select ``Edit''
from the editing bar <IMG
  WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./EditButton.png"
 ALT="Image EditButton">, and
the pencil will be replaced by the arrow. You will need to click on
a symbol to make the cursor reappear.

<P>
The next correction that needs to be made is for the key signature.
The flat is a third too low, and needs to be moved up. There are two
ways to do this, both of which are quite simple. You can either drag
the flat into the right place using the mouse, or select it and use
&lt;ctrl-arrow up&gt; or &lt;ctrl - arrow down&gt; to move it up or down one pitch
at a time. Try moving the flat up and down using these two methods.

<P>
There are three more corrections for the first line that are exactly
the same as for the key signature. The first note, the second rest,
and the custos are all a third too low, and need to be moved up. The
seventh note, a Minim, needs to be changed into a Semi-Minim. You
can do this the same way you changed the initial Long into a Semi-Minim:
Click on the Minim, then click on the Semi-Minim in the editing bar.

<P>
Once you have done this, use the right arrow key to move the cursor
to the second line and continue editing. The sharp in front of the
first note needs to be moved up, and also the custos. Move on to the
third line - first rest needs to be changed from a minim rest to a
semi-minim rest. Then the third rest of the next group of rests needs
to be moved down. The breve before the next fusa (<IMG
  WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="43" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./FusaWithBreve.png"
 ALT="Image FusaWithBreve">)
needs to be replaced with a sharp. Delete the breve, and then try
a short-cut for inputting the sharp. Make the sure fusa is selected
and then press &lt;d&gt;. The sharp should appear at the correct pitch.
There is a similar shortcut for inputting flats - press &lt;b&gt;. There
is no shortcut for the natural sign.

<P>
As you continue to practice editing this page, you should find that
simple replacements, deletions, or pitch corrections are the only
procedures you need to use. At the end of the piece, you will need
to delte the extra long and clef, and then insert two single bar lines
to create the final double bar line. The bar line is found in the
variant family, second to last <IMG
  WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./BarLine.png"
 ALT="Image BarLine">.
Do not confuse this with the Long rest, found in the notes family
<IMG
  WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./LongRest.png"
 ALT="Image LongRest">. Erase the extra bar-line
in the final staff, and you are finished making corrections.

<P>
The final step in editing is adjusting the alignment - making sure
that the symbols on the bottom screen are aligned with those on the
top screen. This cannot be done just by looking, so there is a special
tool in Aruspix for this procedure. Move the cursor to the first clef
at the top of the page, then press &lt;ctrl-b&gt;. This activates the highlight
function, and you will see on the top screen that a row of hand-drawn
blue symbols appears overtop of the original image (Figure <A HREF="#fig:Highlighted-transcription">7</A>).

<P>
The cursor now appears in both screens simultaneously. To move any
of the blue symbols on the top screen, you need to move the corresponding
symbol on the bottom screen. Try to align the blue symbols with their
matching symbols underneath as closely as possible, either by dragging
them with the mouse, or by using the following keyboard commands:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>move to the right: &lt;space bar&gt;
</LI>
<LI>move to the left: &lt;ctrl - spacebar&gt;
</LI>
<LI>move up: &lt;ctrl - up arrow&gt;
</LI>
<LI>move down: &lt;ctrl down arrow&gt;
</LI>
</UL>
When the page is aligned, click ``Save'' to store the corrections.
